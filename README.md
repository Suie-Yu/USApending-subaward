Scholarship Competition - Mini Project

There are 4 steps of this mini-project: exploratory data analysis, network analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning. In the first two parts I explored what the different variables mean and how they relate and correlate with each other. In the NLP part, I performed three steps: TF-IDF calculation, LDA document topic distribution processing and Top-N of topic keywords. In the final machine learning part, I used a linear regression model to predict subaward_amount. Although the model accuracy was low, this was expected in advance.
